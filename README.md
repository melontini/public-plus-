  <summary>Little FAQ</summary>
  
  

**What differentiates this pack from other Vanilla+/Vanilla expanded packs?**

- Plus- tries to integrate vanilla mechanics with mods instead of just tossing them out for a replacement. 
  
  For example, Plus-  doesn't use REI at all, instead we opted to use the recipe book. To do that, every item was sorted into its correct category and grouped together for a cleaner, and a lot more comprehensible experience.

  We also don't use FTB quests or other alternatives, our pack's progression was based on the advancement system.

 

**Is this pack complete, or are there other features planed?**

- Plus- is currently in beta, so expect new updates and improvements.

  One feature I have in mind is adding new pantries from modded logs, but we'll see about that

 

**Can I use shaders with this pack?**

- Yes! This pack ships with the Iris mod, so you can use most of your favorite shaders.

 

**Why 1.16.5?**

- idk
